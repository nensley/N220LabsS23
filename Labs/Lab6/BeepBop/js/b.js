//write a for loop with a variable starting at 1 and running 25 times
//write multiple conditional steps that check for divisibility
//each conditional statement will check to see if the remainder is 0
//if the remainder is 0, then change the iterand to "beep" or "bop"
//first conditional statement tests whether divisibility by 3 AND 5 is true
